# Trading Indicator

I will write about trading indicators in this post.

Both using technical analysis and fundamental analysis can help traders make informed decisions.

I will cover various types of indicators, with elaborate and fundamental math definitions.

## Data types

| Granularity                      | Typical Schema   | Common Industry Term            | Key Contents                                                                       | Typical Uses                                          |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **MBO** (Market‑By‑Order, L3)    | `Schema::Mbo`    | Full order‑book depth / Level 3 | Add, cancel, and execution events for every individual order, including `order_id` | Market making, trade‑match replay, liquidity research |
| **MBP‑10** (Market‑By‑Price, L2) | `Schema::Mbp10`  | 10‑level price depth            | Aggregated order size and updates at each of the top 10 price levels               | Order‑book dynamics, arbitrage modeling               |
| **MBP‑1 / TBBO** (Top Book, L1)  | `Schema::Mbp1`   | Best bid/ask                    | Best bid and ask quotes plus accompanying trades                                   | Basic quote display, NBBO comparison                  |
| **Trades**                       | `Schema::Trades` | Tick‑by‑tick trades / last sale | Every executed trade (price, size, aggressor side, etc.)                           | Price‑volume analysis, VWAP, trade‑driven strategies  |
| **OHLCV‑T**                      | `Schema::Ohlcv`  | Bars / K‑line                   | Aggregated O‑H‑L‑C‑V data per second, minute, hour, or day                         | Backtesting, charting, low‑frequency signals          |

We now only use OHLCV‑T data, the other data types are used for high-frequency trading and are not available in our current setup.

## Moving Averages (MA)

### Simple Moving Average (SMA)

For a price (or data) series $P_t$ and window length $N$:

$$
\text{SMA}_N(t)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} P_{t-i}
$$

- $t$ — index of the current bar (latest observation)
- $P_{t-i}$ — value $i$ bars ago
- $N$ — number of observations in the averaging window

```python
indicator("ta.sma")

pine_sma(x, N) =>
    sum = 0.0
    for i = 0 to N - 1
        sum := sum + x[i] / N
    sum
plot(pine_sma(close, 15))
```

### Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EMA)

For a price series $P_t$ and look‑back length $N$ (often called the “period”):

$$
\operatorname{EMA}_N(t)=\alpha P_t + (1-\alpha)\,\operatorname{EMA}_N(t-1),
\qquad
\alpha=\frac{2}{N+1}.
$$

- **Recursive form** (above) is how trading platforms update the line each new bar.
- **Expanded form**—equivalent but shows the weights explicitly:

$$
\operatorname{EMA}_N(t)=\alpha\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}(1-\alpha)^{i}P_{t-i}.
$$

Because $0 < 1-\alpha < 1$, each older price is multiplied by a progressively smaller factor, so recent data dominate while the whole history still (theoretically) contributes.

```python
indicator("ta.ema")

pine_ema(src, length) =>
    alpha = 2 / (length + 1)
    sum = 0.0
    sum := na(sum[1]) ? src : alpha * src + (1 - alpha) * nz(sum[1])
plot(pine_ema(close,15))
```

| Form                     | Meaning                                                   | Typical use                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`na`** (bare constant) | “Not‑available” — the Pine equivalent of `NaN`/`null`.    | Initialize a series when you _deliberately_ want the first bar(s) to be empty. |
| **`na(x)`** (function)   | Returns **`true`** if `x` is `na`, otherwise **`false`**. | Testing whether a previous‑bar value exists before you do math with it.        |

`nz()` means “not‑na, or zero”.

A simple moving average (SMA) assigns uniform weight inside its window and zero outside,
so its lag to sudden jumps is fixed at roughly $N/2$ bars.
Because EMA weights decay, its effective window shortens automatically when volatility rises:
large moves add more weight to the newest bar and less to the stale tail,
pulling the EMA closer to price. That “elastic” lag gives the EMA its characteristic tighter hug to
the price compared with an SMA of equal period.

Why the EMA curve "looks like that"

**Exponential-decay weighting**

The exponential moving average (EMA) of a series $x_t$ with period $N$ can be written non-recursively as

$$
\mathrm{EMA}_t=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} w_k x_{t-k}, \quad w_k=(1-\alpha)^k \alpha, \quad \alpha=\frac{2}{N+1} .
$$

The weights $w_k$ form a geometric (exponential) sequence that never quite reaches $0$, 
so every past sample contributes, but each step back in time is worth a constant proportion ( $1-\alpha$ ) less than the one before.

Visual effect: the curve bends smoothly toward new prices, but the bend gets shallower the farther the new price is from the old EMA, 
because the distant tail of small weights damps the response. 

**First-order low-pass filter**

is the discrete-time equivalent of the differential equation of a simple RC [low-pass filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter):

$$
\tau \frac{d y(t)}{d t}+y(t)=x(t)
$$

whose impulse response is $e^{-t / \tau}$. That's why the EMA curve has the same exponential relaxation shape when it pulls away from price spikes.

### Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

The MACD is a momentum oscillator that shows the relationship between two EMAs of a security's price.

By tracking how a short‑term EMA “converges toward” or “diverges from” a longer‑term EMA, it highlights changes in trend strength, direction, and momentum.
Gerald Appel introduced it in the late 1970s, and the classic “12‑26‑9” parameters (explained below) remain the default today. 

| Event                                 | Typical reading                                                               | Notes                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Signal‑line crossover**             | DIF crosses **above** DEA → potential buy; crosses **below** → potential sell | Akin to a two‑MA crossover system but applied to DIF vs. its own average. ([Wikipedia][1]) |
| **Zero‑line crossover**               | DIF moves from − to + → trend turns bullish; + to − → bearish                 | Confirms shifts in medium‑term trend direction.                                            |
| **Histogram expansion / contraction** | Growing bars = increasing momentum; shrinking bars = waning momentum          | Gives an early visual cue before line crossovers.                                          |
| **Price / MACD divergence**           | Price makes higher highs while DIF makes lower highs (or vice‑versa)          | Can foreshadow trend reversals, but often produces early signals.                          |

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MACD

$$\text{MACD line} =\mathrm{EMA}_{12}-\mathrm{EMA}_{26}$$

The signal line is then built as the exponential moving average of the MACD line:

$$\text{Signal line} =\mathrm{EMA}_9(\text{MACD line})$$

```python
macd_val  = ta.ema(close, 12) - ta.ema(close, 26)
signal    = ta.ema(macd_val, 9)
hist      = macd_val - signal

plot(macd_val,  color=color.blue,  title="MACD")
plot(signal,    color=color.orange,title="Signal")
plot(hist,      style=plot.style_histogram, title="Histogram")
```
