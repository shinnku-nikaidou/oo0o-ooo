# Headless Server with VNC Remote Control

Merry Christmas ðŸŽ‰. This post covers how to access a Linux desktop remotely.

## Experiment Outline

Purchase a server and install a desktop environment (gnome, plasma, mate or xfce). Run vncserver (tigervnc recommended) on the server, then connect using novnc (running on the server) or a VNC viewer such as RealVNC Viewer or Remmina.

## Preparation

### What is VNC

VNC (Virtual Network Computing) is a graphical desktop-sharing system that uses the Remote Framebuffer (RFB) protocol to control another computer's screen. It lets you view and operate a remote desktop as if you were in front of it, making it ideal for remote work, tech support and education.

### Why use VNC

As mentioned above, combining VNC with a desktop environment turns an otherwise command-line-only server into a real cloud PC (albeit without sound).

### What is noVNC and why use it

noVNC is an open source project that lets you access a remote desktop through a web browser. It implements a VNC client using HTML5 WebSockets and Canvas. In short, you can connect and control a remote computer with a modern browser and no extra software.
Using even a basic proxy, converting VNC to WSS makes the cloud PC feel much faster instead of sluggish.

### Initial setup

A cloud serverâ€”Debian in this example

```bash
âžœ  ~ neofetch
       _,met$$$$$gg.          root@lab.oo0o.ooo
    ,g$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$P.       ----------------------------------

     `$$b.
       `Y$$b.
          `"Y$b._
              `"""
```

## Walkthrough

### Install the desktop environment

Take `xfce` as an example and install the desktop first (since you've read this far, be sure to bookmark Shinnku's site!)

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade
sudo apt install -y tasksel

# If you're on Ubuntu you can simply run (wait, aren't we using Debian?)
sudo tasksel install xubuntu-desktop

# If you're on another system (including Ubuntu)
sudo tasksel
# Then choose xfce and press Enter

sudo apt install gtk2-engines
```

### Installing vncserver

#### Extra steps you can ignore

Here are some unnecessary commandsâ€”see if you can guess what they do

```bash
export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1
sudo /etc/init.d/dbus start &> /dev/null
```

Put the snippet above into `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`.

You can also create a file called `/etc/sudoers.d/dbus` and add the following in it using your username

```bash
your_user_name ALL = (root) NOPASSWD: /etc/init.d/dbus
```

This does come with risks but it should be **ok** for most.

### install vncserver

```bash
apt install tigervnc-standalone-server tigervnc-xorg-extension tigervnc-scraping-server
```

Below is the `vncserver` help output (pasted here to make the post look longer):

```bash
âžœ  ~ vncserver --help
vncserver usage:

  Help can be found in vncserver(1), or via usage of
     -help                   if specified, dumps this help message.
     -h                      is an alias for help.
     -?                      is an alias for help.

  To start a VNC server use vncserver [options] [-- session]
    [:<number>]              specifies the X11 display to be used.
    [-display <value>]       is an alias for :<number>.

                             X509Plain). On default, offer only VncAuth.
    [-geometry <value>]      specifies the desktop geometry, e.g., <width>x<height>.
    [-wmDecoration <value>]  if specified, shrinks the geometry by the given <width>x<height> value.
    [-xdisplaydefaults]      if given, obtain the geometry and pixelformat from a running X server.
    [-xstartup [<value>]]    specifies the script to start an X11 session for Xtigervnc.
    [-noxstartup]            disables X session startup.

    [Xtigervnc options...]   For details, see Xtigervnc(1).
    [-- <session>]           specifies the X11 session to start with either a command or a session name.

  To list all active VNC servers of the user use vncserver
     -list                   if provided, all active VNC servers of the user are listed.
    [:<number>]              specifies the X11 display to be used.
    [-display <value>]       is an alias for :<number>.
    [-rfbport <number>]      provides the TCP port to be used for the RFB protocol.

    [-clean]                 if specified, the log files of the terminated VNC session will also be removed.

  To dump version information use vncserver
    [-version]               dumps version information of underlying Xtigervnc VNC server.

```

Next, run

```bash
âžœ  ~ vncserver -localhost no

You will require a password to access your desktops.

Password:
Verify:
Would you like to enter a view-only password (y/n)? n
A view-only password is not used
/usr/bin/xauth:  file /root/.Xauthority does not exist

New Xtigervnc server 'lab.nkd.red:1 (root)' on port 5901 for display :1.
Use xtigervncviewer -SecurityTypes VncAuth,TLSVnc -passwd /tmp/tigervnc.TJqJuC/passwd lab.nkd.red:1 to connect to the VNC server.
```

And now the result:

## Install noVNC

[https://github.com/novnc/noVNC](https://github.com/novnc/noVNC)

First clone with `git clone https://github.com/novnc/noVNC.git`.
Then run `cd noVNC`

### Install nodejs and pnpm

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install nodejs -y
curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
source /root/.zshrc # source /root/.bashrc
```

### Build noVNC

Even though we installed pnpm above, we'll still use npmâ€”don't ask why.

```bash
npm i
npm run lint
npm run prepublish

# Install numpy to speed up noVNC
apt install python3-numpy
```

## Run noVNC

Assume your vncserver is running on port 5901.

```bash
âžœ  noVNC git:(master) âœ— ./utils/novnc_proxy --vnc localhost:5901 --listen 0.0.0.0:8080
Warning: could not find self.pem
Starting webserver and WebSockets proxy on host 0.0.0.0 port 8080
WebSocket server settings:
  - Listen on 0.0.0.0:8080
  - Web server. Web root: /root/codes/noVNC
  - No SSL/TLS support (no cert file)
  - proxying from 0.0.0.0:8080 to localhost:5901

Navigate to this URL:
    http://0.0.0.0:8080/vnc.html?host=0.0.0.0&port=8080

Press Ctrl-C to exit
```

I modified the URL to `http://lab.nkd.red:8080/vnc.html?host=lab.nkd.red&port=8080` and opened it in a browser

The page opened successfully and felt very smooth.

**Remember to enable remote resizing in the settings and learn to use the clipboardâ€”it helps a lot.**

### Fun stuff

The picture says it all

![novnc-2](/img/posts/23-christmas-lab/novnc-2.jpg)
An endless hallway loop.

## Configure noVNC with SSL (optional)

### install certbot

```bash
sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core
sudo snap install --classic certbot
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
snap set certbot trust-plugin-with-root=ok
sudo snap install certbot-dns-cloudflare

mkdir -p .secrets/certbot

vim .secrets/certbot/cloudflare.ini
```

The contents should be similar to the following. Retrieve your Cloudflare API token via My Profile -> API Tokens -> Edit DNS Zone and paste it here.

```ini
# Cloudflare API token used by Certbot
dns_cloudflare_api_token = xxxXXxxxxxXxxxxxxXxx-w-xxxx-XxxxxX
```

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.secrets/certbot/*
```

Next we sign the certificate for my domain `lab.nkd.red`

### Wildcard certificate

Here we use `nkd.red, *.nkd.red` as an example.

One command takes care of itâ€”nothing else required

```bash
certbot certonly --dns-cloudflare --dns-cloudflare-credentials ~/.secrets/certbot/cloudflare.ini --dns-cloudflare-propagation-seconds 30 -d \*.nkd.red -d nkd.red
```

This command uses Certbotâ€”a free certificate management tool for automating Let's Encrypt SSL certificatesâ€”to obtain an SSL/TLS certificate via Cloudflare's DNS records. The options are explained below:

1. `certbot certonly`: obtain or renew the certificate without configuring the web server.
2. `--dns-cloudflare`: use Cloudflare's DNS API for domain ownership verification.
3. `--dns-cloudflare-credentials ~/.secrets/certbot/cloudflare.ini`: path to your Cloudflare API credentials.
4. `--dns-cloudflare-propagation-seconds 30`: wait 30 seconds for DNS records to propagate.
5. `-d *.nkd.red`: request a wildcard certificate for `*.nkd.red`.
6. `-d nkd.red`: also request a certificate for the root domain `nkd.red`.

In short, the command obtains a wildcard SSL/TLS certificate for nkd.red and all its subdomains using Certbot and the Cloudflare DNS API. It verifies domain ownership via DNS and waits 30 seconds for propagation, allowing one certificate to secure every subdomain.

(generated by ChatGPT 4)

If your domain isn't on Cloudflare (for example if you use DNSPod or another provider), perform manual DNS verification instead:

```bash
certbot certonly --manual \
  --preferred-challenges=dns \
  --email admin@nkd.red \
  --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory \
  --agree-tos \
  -d nkd.red \
  -d "*.nkd.red"
```

Follow the prompts to complete the process

### run noVNC with ssl

Warn: If you use snap install noVNC, due to standard Snap confinement restrictions you need to have them in the `/home/<user>/snap/novnc/current/` directory.

An example command would be on port 8443:

```bash
./utils/novnc_proxy \
  --vnc localhost:5901 \
  --listen 0.0.0.0:8443 \
  --cert /etc/letsencrypt/live/nkd.red/fullchain.pem \
  --key /etc/letsencrypt/live/nkd.red/privkey.pem
```

Then visit `https://lab.nkd.red:8443/vnc.html?host=lab.nkd.red&port=8443`.

![novnc-3](/img/posts/23-christmas-lab/novnc-3.jpg)

run noVNC with ssl/tls/https
