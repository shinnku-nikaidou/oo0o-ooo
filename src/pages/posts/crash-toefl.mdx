## TOEFL Reading

The reading section is the first section you will see on an iBT test.

It tests your ability to understand academic reading material. Academic means the passages are like what you would find in a textbook at university.
All fields of study from chemistry to literature to psychology, etc. are possible topics of the reading passages.

You will need to read two passages and, on average, the length of each is about 700 words.

When doing the reading section, the question is on one side of your screen and the passage is always available on the other side.

When you start each reading passage, it's best to **read it quickly**.

Many of the questions will refer to a specific paragraph, so you can then re-read that section. You don't want to **run out of time**!

Also, you can click through all the questions of a given passage, so you don't have to answer them in order.

Answer all the ones you think are easy and _then use the rest of your time to do the harder questions_.

To make sure you don't miss any, there is a review button that will open up a screen listing all the questions and show if they were answered or not.

### The Question Type

1. Factual questions (2 to 3 questions per set)
2. Negative factual questions (0 to 2 questions per set)
3. Vocabulary (3 to 4 questions per set)
4. Rhetorical purpose questions (1 to 2 questions per set)
5. Inference questions (1 to 2 questions per set)
6. Sentence simplification questions (0 to 1 questions per set)
7. Insert text questions (1 question per set)
8. Summary questions (1 question per set)
9. Fill in a table (1 question per set, but 2 points)

#### Prose Summary and Fill-in-a-table Questions

You need to complete a table based on information from the passage.

You will need to drag and drop the correct answers to complete the table. They test your ability to organize information into appropriate categories.
These questions, like summary questions, require a mental framework. You can earn up to 3 points.

## TOEFL Listerning

In the Listening section of the IBT test, you will hear dialogues and academic talks, and you will be tested on your ability to understand them. You will hear each passage only once, and then answer questions after each is finished. The listening questions ask about the main idea, supporting details, and the way the speakers use language. You need to answer each listening question based on what is stated or implied by the speakers. Keep your headphones on for the entire Listening section because there is audio for the questions too, they are not just seen on your screen.

The revised TOEFL test effective July 26, 2023 has 5 listening passages: There are **3 academic talks and 2 dialogues**. Each academic talk has 6 listening questions. Each dialogue has 5 listening questions. So there are 28 questions in total. The timer only counts down as you answer the questions. The total time allowed for the Listening section is an estimated 36 minutes.

You don't just hear the academic talks and dialogues. Each passage runs as a video. It's not quite like a movie though as there are only still images that change. The images are to help you imagine the situation and the roles of the people talking. Some of the images you might **see are vocabulary terms** written on a board. Each passage will range from 2-6 minutes (the dialogues are generally about 2-3 minutes long, while a lecture is generally 3-6 minutes long).

There's 4 main categories – Social Sciences, Physical Sciences, Life Sciences and the Arts – from which a wide range of topics are used in the academic talks. The topic could be anything from architecture to medical techniques to oceanography to modern history. The listening passages are meant to represent what you would hear in a lecture at university. You might hear only the professor speaking, which can include an accent (North American (not just American), British, Australian, New Zeland) or stuttering or miscues. In other words, it's just like a professor would talk in a real class. Some of them will have 1-2 students asking the professor questions, or the professor might call on 1-2 students to answer something.

For the dialogues, they are meant to represent a real conversation that can happen somewhere on a **university campus** between a student and a professor, or a counsellor, or someone who works on campus. Some will have a student going to see a professor about an assignment or a course requirement. Others have a student interacting with someone who for example works in the library, a restaurant, the bookstore, or the admissions office.

There are 9 types of listening questions and 4 different kinds of formats used. You may run into ONE question in the entire Listening section that is worth 2 points. Directions for such a question will clearly state it is worth 2 points. Although you'll do 28 questions, the scaled score for the listening section has a maximum value of 30. No, we're not sure how ETS calculates the score to 30.

Even if you are not familiar with the topic, if your English is good enough, you will be able to answer all the questions based on the information in the listening passage. One of the best things to do to help you answer the questions is to take notes. It's unlikely you'll be able to remember all the details, especially if it's a completely unfamiliar topic. Also remember that all you need to know to answer the questions for a passage is in the material provided. No prior knowledge of any of the topics is expected of you.

Unlike the Reading section, you must answer each question one after another. If you don't know or are unsure about the answer, try to eliminate options that are clearly wrong and then pick one from the ones that remain. You don't want to run out of time! You should try not to spend more than 30 seconds per question for a dialogue, and 35 seconds per question for a lecture.

So what are the listening questions like? We'll go over the 4 formats and 9 types. You will never get all of them with a single passage.
