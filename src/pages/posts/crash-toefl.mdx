## TOEFL Reading

The very first part of the TOEFL exam is the reading section. In the reading, you will find two academic
passages, each followed by a series of questions. Each passage is approximately 700 words long. The
subjects are unpredictable. Each TOEFL test is different, so there is no way for you to anticipate what kind
of topic you will encounter on test day. However, there are some popular academic topics, which include
but are not limited to _history, biology, astronomy, zoology, anthropology, geography, geology, sociology, and
art_.

It tests your ability to understand academic reading material. Academic means the passages are like what you would find in a textbook at university.
All fields of study from chemistry to literature to psychology, etc. are possible topics of the reading passages.

As of 2023, the updated TOEFL exam will provide you with 36 minutes to complete the reading section.
After each reading passage, you will find 10 questions about the text. In other words, you have 36 minutes
to read approximately 1400 words (700 words per passage) and answer 20 questions (10 questions per
passage). Reading 1400 words and answering 20 questions in 36 minutes is tough.

You probably will not have enough time to read the passage and then answer the questions. The questions are arranged in
the same order as the reading passage, so most TOEFL test-takers read and answer questions at the same
time.

For example, if question two is in paragraph two, 95% of the time you can find the answer to
question three later in the same paragraph or in the next paragraph, paragraph three. The answer to
question three would not be in paragraph one because that would put it out of sequential order. In other
words, each question is placed in relation to where the answer is in the reading.
It is also important for you to be familiar with what the TOEFL test looks like on a computer screen. Look at
the image on the top right of the following page. Be sure to monitor your time carefully. Time
management is a crucial aspect of the entire exam, but it is particularly important for the reading section.
When you study at home, be sure to practice with a clock.

When doing the reading section, the question is on one side of your screen and the passage is always available on the other side.

When you start each reading passage, it's best to **read it quickly**.

Many of the questions will refer to a specific paragraph, so you can then re-read that section. You don't want to **run out of time**!

Also, you can click through all the questions of a given passage, so you don't have to answer them in order.

Answer all the ones you think are easy and _then use the rest of your time to do the harder questions_.

To make sure you don't miss any, there is a review button that will open up a screen listing all the questions and show if they were answered or not.

### The Question Type

### Time Management for the TOEFL® Reading Section

One of the hardest parts of the TOEFL reading is time management.

When you work through the TOEFL Reading section, you will notice that some questions take longer than others. For example, vocabulary questions are rather simple and straightforward, so they should take you no more than 60 seconds to complete. Negative detail questions, on the other hand, could take up to 120 seconds to answer. Below is a breakdown of the maximum amount of time you can spend on a given question based on its type.

- Vocabulary - 60 seconds
- Factual Information - 90 seconds
- Negative Factual Information - 120 seconds
- Sentence Simplification - 120 seconds
- Insert Text - 90 seconds
- Inference - 90 seconds
- Rhetorical Purpose - 90 seconds
- Reference - 60 seconds
- Summary - 150 seconds
- Fill In a Table - 150 seconds

## TOEFL Listerning

In the Listening section of the IBT test, you will hear dialogues and academic talks, and you will be tested on your ability to understand them. You will hear each passage only once, and then answer questions after each is finished. The listening questions ask about the main idea, supporting details, and the way the speakers use language. You need to answer each listening question based on what is stated or implied by the speakers. Keep your headphones on for the entire Listening section because there is audio for the questions too, they are not just seen on your screen.

The revised TOEFL test effective July 26, 2023 has 5 listening passages: There are **3 academic talks and 2 dialogues**. Each academic talk has 6 listening questions. Each dialogue has 5 listening questions. So there are 28 questions in total. The timer only counts down as you answer the questions. The total time allowed for the Listening section is an estimated 36 minutes.

You don't just hear the academic talks and dialogues. Each passage runs as a video. It's not quite like a movie though as there are only still images that change. The images are to help you imagine the situation and the roles of the people talking. Some of the images you might **see are vocabulary terms** written on a board. Each passage will range from 2-6 minutes (the dialogues are generally about 2-3 minutes long, while a lecture is generally 3-6 minutes long).

There's 4 main categories – Social Sciences, Physical Sciences, Life Sciences and the Arts – from which a wide range of topics are used in the academic talks. The topic could be anything from architecture to medical techniques to oceanography to modern history. The listening passages are meant to represent what you would hear in a lecture at university. You might hear only the professor speaking, which can include an accent (North American (not just American), British, Australian, New Zeland) or stuttering or miscues. In other words, it's just like a professor would talk in a real class. Some of them will have 1-2 students asking the professor questions, or the professor might call on 1-2 students to answer something.

For the dialogues, they are meant to represent a real conversation that can happen somewhere on a **university campus** between a student and a professor, or a counsellor, or someone who works on campus. Some will have a student going to see a professor about an assignment or a course requirement. Others have a student interacting with someone who for example works in the library, a restaurant, the bookstore, or the admissions office.

There are 9 types of listening questions and 4 different kinds of formats used. You may run into ONE question in the entire Listening section that is worth 2 points. Directions for such a question will clearly state it is worth 2 points. Although you'll do 28 questions, the scaled score for the listening section has a maximum value of 30. No, we're not sure how ETS calculates the score to 30.

Even if you are not familiar with the topic, if your English is good enough, you will be able to answer all the questions based on the information in the listening passage. One of the best things to do to help you answer the questions is to **take notes**. It's unlikely you'll be able to remember all the details, especially if it's a completely unfamiliar topic. Also remember that all you need to know to answer the questions for a passage is in the material provided. No prior knowledge of any of the topics is expected of you.

Unlike the Reading section, **you must answer each question one after another**. If you don't know or are unsure about the answer, try to eliminate options that are clearly wrong and then pick one from the ones that remain.

> You don't want to run out of time! You should try not to spend more than **30 seconds** per question for a dialogue, and **35 seconds** per question for a lecture.

### TOEFL Listening Section Practice Guide

- **Comprehension** – Increase the playback speed of a TOEFL listening passage between 1.1 × and 1.5 ×. Take notes and answer the questions. Your goal is to get at least 4 out of 6 questions correct.
- **Vocabulary** – Try to use 2‑3 new words in your speaking or writing responses that will help you in your listening (e.g., _proposal_).
- **Topic Knowledge** – Conduct a 2‑5‑minute conversation with a chatbot about a topic you do not understand (e.g., _Intentionality_).
- **Question Strategy** – Identify a question type you struggle with (e.g., gist‑purpose question). Practice answering three questions and explain why each option is correct or incorrect.
- **Notetaking** – Write down only consonants and content words in your notes and summarize them to a friend, teacher, or chatbot.

## TOEFL Writing

### TOEFL Writing Section Overview

For TOEFL beginners, it is recommended that you stick to the templates and look through other sections for ideas. When starting out, you should try to keep your responses clear and simple, so stick to the basic templates at first.

For experienced TOEFL takers, if you have not yet reached your score, one of the reasons may be due to a lack of vocabulary and grammar. Pay close attention to the **synonym list** to help you. There will also be a list of Integrated Writing essays and Writing for an Academic Discussion responses to learn from.

#### Task 1: Integrated Writing

- Read a passage (3 minutes).
- Listen to a related lecture.
- Write your response in 20 minutes.

#### Task 2: Writing for an Academic Discussion

- Read an online discussion.
- Contribute to the conversation.
- Complete within 10 minutes.

#### Tips:

1.  Do not use personal pronone. Don't say: "I", "me", "my".
2.  All you have to do is giving a summary. You're not giving your own opinion.
3.  You can only use pronoun "we" only if the lecturer use the pronoun "we". Also no "he", no "she"
    - the passage said this
    - the lecturer suggestes that
4.  structure setup
    1.  intro
        - the reading passage states that...
        - the professor/lecturer counters this
    2.  body
        1.  point 1, example 1
        2.             2, xxxx
        3.  etc.

> You do not need a conclusion paragraph or conclusion statement **(not necessity)**. All you do is giving a summary, and no need to give a summary statement to the end

### Integrated Writing

Think Like a Reporter

> You **should not include your opinion** in this response. Imagine that you are a reporter describing the news.

1. Type #1: Supporting a plan, theory or point of view
