## Setting & model

### Online Bipartite Matching

The author Karp, Vazirani, and Vazirani introduce a bipartite graph model $G =(U \cup V, E)$, 
where $U$ is given offline and $V$ arrives online [KVV90].
The online algorithm must irrevocably match each arriving vertex $v \in V$ to an unmatched neighbor in $U$ or leave it unmatched.

The offline optimal is defined as the maximum matching in $G$.
The competitive ratio is defined as the expected size of the matching produced by the online algorithm divided by the size of the offline optimal matching.

$$
Ratio = ALG / OPT
$$

### Online Stochastic Matching Problem

In the online matching problem with stochastic rewards, every edge $(u, v)$ also has an associated probability of success $p_{uv}$. 

When a new vertex $v \in V$ arrives online, the algorithm either chooses not to assign it at all, or assigns it to one of its neighbors (these are the available options). 

If $v$ is assigned to $u \in U$ using the edge $(u, v)$, a Bernoulli experiment is performed and the edge $(u, v)$ becomes a successful assignment with probability $p_{uv}$.

In successful assignment case, we say that $u$ was successful and remove it from the set of *available* vertices. 
On the other hand, if the assignment $(u, v)$ is not successful, $u$ remains available and a neighbor of $u$ that arrives later in the online order can be assigned to $u$ (but $v$ cannot be assigned in the future). 

The overall objective is to maximize the *expected* number of successful vertices $u \in U$, or equivalently, the expected number of successful assignments.
