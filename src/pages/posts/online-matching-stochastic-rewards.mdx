## Setting & model

### Online Bipartite Matching

The author Karp, Vazirani, and Vazirani introduce a bipartite graph model $G =(U \cup V, E)$,
where $U$ is given offline and $V$ arrives online [KVV90].
The online algorithm must irrevocably match each arriving vertex $v \in V$ to an unmatched neighbor in $U$ or leave it unmatched.

The offline optimal is defined as the maximum matching in $G$.
The competitive ratio is defined as the expected size of the matching produced by the online algorithm divided by the size of the offline optimal matching.

$$
Ratio = ALG / OPT
$$

### Online Stochastic Matching Problem

In the online matching problem with stochastic rewards, every edge $(u, v)$ also has an associated probability of success $p_{uv}$.

When a new vertex $v \in V$ arrives online, the algorithm either chooses not to assign it at all, or assigns it to one of its neighbors (these are the available options).

If $v$ is assigned to $u \in U$ using the edge $(u, v)$, a Bernoulli experiment is performed and the edge $(u, v)$ becomes a successful assignment with probability $p_{uv}$.

In successful assignment case, we say that $u$ was successful and remove it from the set of _available_ vertices.
On the other hand, if the assignment $(u, v)$ is not successful, $u$ remains available and a neighbor of $u$ that arrives later in the online order can be assigned to $u$ (but $v$ cannot be assigned in the future).

The overall objective is to maximize the _expected_ number of successful vertices $u \in U$, or equivalently, the expected number of successful assignments.

### Vertex-Weighted Stochastic Matching

In the vertex-weighted variant, each offline vertex $u \in U$ has a nonnegative weight $w_u$.
A successful assignment on $u$ yields reward $w_u$ and removes $u$ from availability (as before).
The objective becomes maximizing the **expected total weight** of successful offline vertices:

$$
\max \; \mathbb{E}\!\left[\sum_{u \in U} w_u \cdot \mathbf{1}\{u\ \text{is matched successfully}\}\right].
$$

The unweighted model is the special case $w_u \equiv 1$.

The four probability regimes below (Vanishing/Arbitrary × Equal/Unequal) remain the same; results in recent work typically extend to the vertex-weighted case with essentially the same analyses.

## Offline Optimal Benchmark

## Definition of Competitive Ratio

For the **unweighted** case, the competitive ratio is $\mathbb{E}[ALG]/OPT$.

For the **vertex-weighted** case, the competitive ratio is $\mathbb{E}[ALG_w]/OPT_w$.

A convenient upper bound/benchmark is the (configuration) LP relaxation; a simple edge-based LP that suffices for exposition is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\max \quad & \sum_{u \in U} w_u\cdot p_{uv} \cdot x_{uv} \\
\text{s.t.}\quad
& \sum_{v \in N(u)} p_{uv}\, x_{uv} \;\le\; 1 \qquad && \forall u \in U \\
& \sum_{u \in N(v)} x_{uv} \;\le\; 1 \qquad && \forall v \in V \\
& 0 \le x_{uv}
\end{aligned}
$$

Here $x_{uv}$ is the (fractional) probability of attempting $(u,v)$, and $y_u$ upper-bounds the success probability of $u$.
Setting all $w_u\equiv 1$ recovers the unweighted benchmark.

## Distribution of the Success Threshold (Ө)

Let $\tau$ be the round of the first success when repeatedly attempting the same offline vertex $u$. Then

$$
\tau \sim \operatorname{Geom}(p) \quad(\tau=1,2,3, \ldots) .
$$

Measure "load" as the cumulative success probability: each attempt adds $p$. Define

$$
\Theta:=p \cdot \tau .
$$

Hence,

$$
\operatorname{Pr}[\Theta=t p]=p(1-p)^{t-1} \quad(t=1,2, \ldots)
$$

so $\Theta$ only takes values in $\{p, 2 p, 3 p, \ldots\}$. A vertex $u$ becomes successful the first time its accumulated load $\ell_u$ reaches or exceeds $\Theta$. This is exactly the "equivalent threshold view" used by Mehta-Panigrahi.

Basic moments. $\mathbb{E}[\Theta]=1$ and $\operatorname{Var}(\Theta)=1-p$. Thus, as $p \rightarrow 0$, both the mean and the variance tend to 1.

Vanishing limit $(p \rightarrow 0)$. Viewing the discrete distribution as a continuous-load approximation,

$$
\operatorname{Pr}[\Theta>x]=(1-p)^{\lfloor x / p\rfloor} \underset{p \rightarrow 0}{\longrightarrow} e^{-x}
$$

i.e., $\Theta \Rightarrow \operatorname{Exp}(1)$. Consequently, in small- $p$ analyses it is standard to model each offline vertex's threshold as an independent $\operatorname{Exp}(1)$ random variable.

Unequal but small probabilities. If the edge success probabilities $p_{u v}$ differ but are all small, we still measure load as the sum of allocated success probabilities.
In this continuous-load coordinate, the threshold is well-approximated by $\operatorname{Exp}(1)$; each attempt just increments the load by the corresponding $p_{u v}$ instead of a fixed $p$.
